ModTools 0.9.5 (2024-03-25)
-----------------------------

NEW FUNCTIONS ADDED:
  * Following functions have been moved from DescTools because
    they fit thematically better here:
    BrierScore(), Conf(), Cstat(), HosmerLemeshowTest(),
    BreuschGodfreyTest(), MAE(), MAPE(), ModSummary(),
    MSE(), NMAE(), NMSE(), PseudoR2(),
    RMSE(), Sens(), SMAPE(), Spec(), StdCoef(), TMod(), VIF()
  * Started to roxygenize the documentation. This will be continued.
  * BrierScoreCI(), CstatCI(), and RSqCI() return bootstrap
    confidence intervals for the specific measures (based on glm, resp. lm).
