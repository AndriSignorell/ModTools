Description: Collection of tools for regression and classification tasks. The package implements a consistent user interface to the most popular regression and classification algorithms, such as random forest, neural networks, C5 trees and support vector machines, and complements it with a handful of auxiliary functions, such as variable importance and a tuning function for the parameters.
